# sac - Julia code to run the Stochastic Analytic Continuation Method
Currently supports unconstrained sampling, the $\delta$-function edge parameterization, and the power-law edge constrained parameterization for fermionic or bosonic spectral functions.

The functions contained in this folder can be used to run a cross validation procedure as a tool for model selection. This can be read about in depth in our [PRE article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06763).

The process goes as values:
* collect your QMC-generated bins in a `cor.dat` files as detailed [here](./sac/README.md)
